# Machine Learning in Genetic Disorder and Disorder Subclass Prediction.

Hereditary illnesses are becoming more common due to a lack of understanding about the need for genetic testing. 
Using machine learning we'll predict genetic disorders and the disorder subclass using the various techniques we encountered in the "MATLAB for Data Science" class.

The field of genomics generates vast datasets, AI and ML provide tools to decipher complex genetic information. 
MATLAB's Bioinformatics Toolbox is particularly notable for its comprehensive functionalities designed for the processing of genomic data.

The discipline of genomics, concerned with the comprehensive analysis of organisms' entire DNA, stands in contrast to genetics, which concentrates on the roles of individual genes in heredity. 
Due to the advancements in sequencing technologies, the era of genomics has accumulated a wealth of data, necessitating the adoption of new computational methodologies. 

As highlighted in the National Human Genome Research Institute's publication "Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Genomics", 
the genomics field is increasingly harnessing computational techniques to discover patterns within extensive genomics datasets from both foundational and clinical research initiatives. 

John Holland's work with genetic algorithms in "Adaptation in Natural and Artificial Systems" underlines much of the current understanding within this domain.
Although this project does not directly engage with genetic algorithms, the influence between biology and AI remains a critical point of consideration.

This project primarily uses MATLAB.
Data preprocessing was performed through custom code, while the machine learning model was implemented using MATLAB's built-in applications, 
specifically the "Classification Learner" in the "Machine Learning and Deep Learning" toolbox.
